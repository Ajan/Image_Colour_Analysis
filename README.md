# Image Color Analysis

This Python program analyzes the types of colors present in an image. It categorizes the colors into basic color types such as red, green, blue, gray, and mixed. The program utilizes the Pillow library to extract the RGB values of each pixel in the image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the program files.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install Pillow
   ```
   
##   Usage
1. Place the image file you want to analyze in the same directory as the program files.
2. Open the analyze_colors.py file and replace the 'path/to/your/image.jpg' with the actual path to your image file.
3. Save the changes.
4. Run the program by executing the following command:
```shell
python ICA.py
```
The program will process the image and display the types of colors found along with their respective counts.
